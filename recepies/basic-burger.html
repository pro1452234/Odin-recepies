            Nothing says summer quite like a juicy grilled burger. 
            You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, 
            but here's what you can expect when you make these top-rated burger patties: 
        </p>
        <p>
            Begin by whisking the egg, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. 
            Then, add the ground beef and bread crumbs before forming the mixture into Â¾-inch patties. 
            Place the patties on a preheated grill and <em>for six to eight minutes per side. </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Make sure the beef's temperature reads at <em>least 160 degrees F</em>  before serving, 
            and you're ready to go. Top with classic condiments like mustard, ketchup, and mayo for full-fledged flavor.
