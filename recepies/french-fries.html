        <ol>
            <li>
                Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water 
                to prevent them from turning brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to <strong>350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. 
                Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. 
                Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about <strong>7 to 10 minutes.</strong>  
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve hot and enjoy!
